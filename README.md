# Group-Chat-Private-Chat-Application-using-MEAN-And-Socket.io
-I have implemented GroupChat Application using MEAN Stack and for real time communication like sending messages ,joining and leaving rooms ,I have used Socket.IO which is a library for Real Time Web Applications.The purpose of the project is to become capable of using socket.io for RTC(Real Time Communication).


## Socket.IO
- Socket.IO is a powerful library for real time web  applications.It enables real time,bidirectional and event based communication between the browser and the server
- It is built on top of Websockets API and Node.js.
- It is mostly dependent on NPM.
- It is fast and reliable.Whenever any event occurs the server will get that event  and emit the event to particular connected client.
